### Manage access to the repository

The fact that repository can be private or public already influences the basic aspects of repository's access management, as discussed in the [Public vs Private repositories](../repository/#public-vs-private-repositories) section, so we will not repeat it here.
However, there are more advanced features that allow you to manage access to the repository in more detail.

A GitHub repository can belong either to an individual user or to a GitHub organization (a group of users):

  - If the repository belongs to an individual, that user is the owner and has full administrative control.

  - If the repository belongs to an organization, then the organization owners are the admins of all repositories within the organization.
