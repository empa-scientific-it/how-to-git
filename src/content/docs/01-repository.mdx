### Create a repository

To start the tutorial, we need to create a repository.
The repository will serve as a place to store our text file.

To create a repository, please go to your GitHub account, select the "Repositories" tab and click on the green "New" button.
Alternatively, you can click on [this link](https://github.com/new).

In the newly opened page, please fill in the following fields:

<Steps>

1. Set the **repository name** to `git-tutorial`

2. Set the **description** to `Git tutorial` (optional)

3. Make sure the **visibility** is set to _Public_ (default)

4. Leave the rest of the options set to default

5. Click on the green button "Create repository"

</Steps>

Congratulations, you have created your first GitHub repository!
The repository is empty, so we need to add a file to it.

### Public vs Private repositories

Issue [#9](https://github.com/empa-scientific-it/how-to-git/issues/9)

### Add a file to the repository

To add a file to the repository, please click on the "uploading an existing file" link.
In the newly opened page, please drag and drop a text file to the drag and drop area.
You can create the file on your computer using any available text editor.
The file can contain any text you want, but usually the programmers like to put "Hello, World!", so let's follow the tradition.
The filename does not matter.

Let's not modify any other fields and click the green "Commit changes" button.
Congratulations, you have added a file to the repository!
