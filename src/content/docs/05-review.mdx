### What are Reviews good for? 
When working together on a project, changes are usually made in branches and checked before merging into the main branch.
Reviews let teammates give feedback, helping you see your work from a fresh perspective and improve it.
Reviews arenâ€™t just for code; they can also cover documentation, designs, or settings.
They can even be made required to keep quality and consistency high.
The common types are code reviews, resp. pull request (PR) reviews, but reviews can also be done on other source of text.
In Github projects, reviews can be made obligatory, which can help for supervising changes.

<Aside type="tip">
Be friendly and specific while reviewing: Tell what needs to be changed and how, and give a reason if it is not clear.
</Aside>

### Request review from author
A review should be requested, if the work on a topic has finished.
If the work on a topic has finished, means the branch can be merged to the main branch.
For that a Pull Request is opened and, one can choose a review from someone specific.
It makes more sense, if the person to review it is not involved in that specific topic, but is close to the it.

** To create a PR review, you first open a [Pull Request](https://github.com/empa-scientific-it/how-to-git/blob/main/src/content/docs/03-parallel-topics.mdx#merge-branches).
** On the top right you can choose who to assign for the review.
** As soon as the reviewer is done, you will get a notification.


### Request changes from reviewer
[Description TODO]
- Since the text to be reviewed was written one line per sentence (maybe reference to where we described this) the requested changes can be more easier done.
- Pick one sentence and say how or why to change it.
- Best weay to cite it and make the changes


### Author handling of Request changes from reviewer
[Description TODO]
- accepting them
- not accepting them
- adressing them in new issues for later changes?

<Aside type="tip">
[Maybe this should be a Note and not a tip, if it is possible]
Changes and reviews will go back and forth until every party is satisfied with the content.
</Aside>


### Request a change to some part of the text from someone
[Describe TODO]
- Best way is to create an issue, assing it to that creator to ask for changes in certain topic
- person can later create a branche from that issue, create changes and ask you to be the reviewer
- are there other ways?
