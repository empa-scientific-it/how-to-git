### What are Reviews good for? 
When working together on a project, changes are usually made in branches and checked before merging into the main branch.
Reviews let teammates give feedback, helping you see your work from a fresh perspective and improve it.
Reviews arenâ€™t just for code; they can also cover documentation, designs, or settings.
They can even be made required to keep quality and consistency high.
The common types are code reviews, resp. pull request (PR) reviews, but reviews can also be done on other source of text.
In Github projects, reviews can be made obligatory, which can help for supervising changes.

<Aside type="tip">
Be friendly and specific while reviewing: Tell what needs to be changed and how, and give a reason if it is not clear.
</Aside>

### Request a review as an author
A review should be requested, if the work on a topic has finished.
If the work on a topic has finished, means the branch can be merged to the main branch.
For that a Pull Request is opened and, one can choose a review from someone specific.
It makes more sense, if the person to review it is not involved in that specific topic, but is close to the it.

- To create a PR review, you first open a [Pull Request](../docs/03-parallel-topics.mdx#merge-branches).
- On the top right you can choose who to assign for the review.
- Now you need to wait for the reviewer to be finished


### Make changes as a reviewer

As a reviewer you will get a notification (depending on your settings) that you are requested.
1. You can start the review by clicking on the green button.
1. Go to a line of text that you would change, click on the plus symbol :heavy_plus_sign: (Remember, we recommend to always only use one Line per sentence [here](../docs/02-track-changes.mdx#change-files))
3. Either add a comment, or choose to make a suggestion (click on the plusminus symbol), which gives you the option to do changes to a sentence.
  - A suggestion can simply be accepted by the author, where as a comment just gives a hint for a change
4. Click the green button to start the review or add review to previous.
5. When you finsished your comments click the green button for "finish your review" on the top
  - This will give a notification to the author for further actions

### Author handling of Request changes from reviewer
[Description TODO]
- accepting them
- not accepting them
- adressing them in new issues for later changes?

<Aside type="tip">
[Maybe this should be a Note and not a tip, if it is possible]
Changes and reviews will go back and forth until every party is satisfied with the content.
</Aside>


### Request a change to some part of the text from someone
[Describe TODO]
- Best way is to create an issue, assing it to that creator to ask for changes in certain topic
- person can later create a branche from that issue, create changes and ask you to be the reviewer
- are there other ways?
