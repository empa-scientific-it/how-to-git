### For what are Reviews good for? 
When working together on a project, changes are usually made in branches and checked before merging into the main branch.
Reviews let teammates give feedback, helping you see your work from a fresh perspective and improve it.
Reviews aren’t just for code — they can also cover documentation, designs, or settings.
They can even be made required to keep quality and consistency high.
The common types are code reviews, resp. pull request (PR) reviews, but reviews can also be done on other source of text.
In Github projects, reviews can be made obligatory, which can help for supervising changes.

<Aside type="tip">
[Maybe rewrite sentence]
Be friendly and specific: say what has changed or why you need changes or a review.
</Aside>

### Request review from author
[Description TODO]
- When changes in a branch are finished
- When it should be merged with main branch
- ask for review from someone that is close to that topic

### Request changes from reviewer
[Description TODO]
- Since the text to be reviewed was written one line per sentence (maybe reference to where we described this) the requested changes can be more easier done.
- Pick one sentence and say how or why to change it.
- Best weay to cite it and make the changes


### Author handling of Request changes from reviewer
[Description TODO]
- accepting them
- not accepting them
- adressing them in new issues for later changes?

<Aside type="tip">
[Maybe this should be a Note and not a tip, if it is possible]
Changes and reviews will go back and forth until every party is satisfied with the content.
</Aside>


### Request a change to some part of the text from someone
[Describe TODO]
- Best way is to create an issue, assing it to that creator to ask for changes in certain topic
- person can later create a branche from that issue, create changes and ask you to be the reviewer
- are there other ways?
