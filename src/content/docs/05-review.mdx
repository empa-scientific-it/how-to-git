[Introduction with following topics]
- changes can be reviewed before merges from branches to the main
- reviews enables others to give feedback
- feedback helps to see content with other eyes and improves
- [are there Different kinds of reviews? or only code review, resp. PR review?]
- Reviews can be made obligatory

<Aside type="tip">
[Maybe rewrite sentence]
Be friendly and specific: say what has changed or why you need changes or a review.
</Aside>

### Request review from author
[Description TODO]
- When changes in a branch are finished
- When it should be merged with main branch
- ask for review from someone that is close to that topic

### Request changes from reviewer
[Description TODO]
- Since the text to be reviewed was written one line per sentence (maybe reference to where we described this) the requested changes can be more easier done.
- Pick one sentence and say how or why to change it.
- Best weay to cite it and make the changes


### Author handling of Request changes from reviewer
[Description TODO]
- accepting them
- not accepting them
- adressing them in new issues for later changes?

<Aside type="tip">
[Maybe this should be a Note and not a tip, if it is possible]
Changes and reviews will go back and forth until every party is satisfied with the content.
</Aside>


### Request a change to some part of the text from someone
[Describe TODO]
- Best way is to create an issue, assing it to that creator to ask for changes in certain topic
- person can later create a branche from that issue, create changes and ask you to be the reviewer
- are there other ways?
