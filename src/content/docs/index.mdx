The tutorial is designed to give practical experience with Git.
Various interfaces rely on it.
In this tutorial, Git functionality is explained using GitHub, but there are other web interfaces, including [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/product/).
Most of the functionality can be accessed via the browser, so it is not necessary to have Git installed on your computer for basic usage.
We will provide instructions on how to use the browser interface alongside the command line interface.

<Aside type="tip" title="No code knowledge required">
  Based on experience, it is simpler not to start with coding examples when
  learning about Git. Instead, we will use a text file, since code is ultimately
  just text.
