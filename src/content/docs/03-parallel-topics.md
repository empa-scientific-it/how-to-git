### Plan your work and record issues

Before writing any text, it is important to plan what needs to be done.
Git provides tools like Issues, to help you organize your work visually and collaboratively.

So before starting, you can ask yourself and your team:
- What tasks need to be completed?
- Who is responsible for what?
- How do we break large problems into smaller, trackable tasks?

#### Why issues?

Issues are like digital sticky notes used to track tasks, features, or bugs.
They help you document your work and keep track of progress.
Each issue has a title and description.
You can comment, tag people, add labels, and so much more.

#### Open your first issue

On your repository's main page, click on the Tab labeled :radio_button:`Issues`.
Then, at the top-right corner, click on the green button labeled "New issue".
In the newly opened page for issue creation, you are now asked to provide a title and a description for the issue.
It is mandatory to give it a title, but even though description is optional, it is strongly recommended to include one, as it will provide more detail.
The description is in Markdown syntax, which allows you to format the text to make it more readable.

#### Labels, assignees etc

### Branching out topics

Issue [#5](https://github.com/empa-scientific-it/how-to-git/issues/5).

> One of the biggest advantages of Git is its branching capabilities.

Unlike centralised version control systems, Git branches are cheap and easy to merge.
This facilitates the feature branch workflow popular with many Git users.
Feature branches provide an isolated environment for every change to your codebase. (from https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/why-git)
