# Git tutorial

The tutorial is desigined to give practical experience with Git.
The only assumption we put is that you have a GitHub account.
Most of the things can be done in the browser, so we do not strictly require to have Git installed on your computer.
At the same time we will provide instructions on how to do the same thing using command line interface.

## No code

From our experience and experience of the others, no code is too simple to be used in the tutorial.
Any programming language we could pick will would derail the attention from the Git's essentials.
In the end, any code is just a text.
Therefore, we will focus on editing a text file.


## Create a repository

To start the tutorial, we need to create a repository.
The repository will serve as a place to store our text file.
To create a repository, please go to your GitHub account, select the "Repositories" tab and click on the green "New" button.
Alternatively, you can click on [this link](https://github.com/new).
In the newly opened page, please fill in the following fields:
- **Repository name**: `git-tutorial`
- (optional) **Description**: `Git tutorial`
- **Public**: (leave it as is)
- **Initialize this repository with a README**: (leave it unchecked)
- **Add .gitignore**: None (default)
- **Choose a license**: None (default)

After that, please click on the green "Create repository" button.

Congratulations, you have created your first GitHub repository!
The repository is empty, so we need to add a file to it.


## Add a file to the repository
To add a file to the repository, please click on the "uploading an existing file" link.
In the newly opened page, please drag and drop a txt file to the drag and drop area.
You can create the file on your computer using any available text editor.
The file can contain any text you want, but usually the programmers like to put "Hello, World!", so let's follow the tradition.
The filename does not matter.

Let's not modify any other fields and click the green "Commit changes" button.
Congratulations, you have added a file to the repository!
