# Git tutorial

The tutorial is designed to give practical experience with Git.
Various interfaces rely on it. 
In this tutorial, Git functionality is explained using GitHub, but there are other web interfaces, including [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/product/).
Most of the functionality can be accessed via the browser, so it is not necessary to have Git installed on your computer for basic usage.
We will provide instructions on how to use the browser interface alongside the command line interface.

## No code knowledge is required to start

Based on experience, it is simpler not to start with coding examples when learning about Git.
Instead, we will use a text file, since code is ultimately just text.

## Create a repository

To start the tutorial, we need to create a repository.
The repository will serve as a place to store our text file.
To create a repository, please go to your GitHub account, select the "Repositories" tab and click on the green "New" button.
Alternatively, you can click on [this link](https://github.com/new).
In the newly opened page, please fill in the following fields:
- **Repository name**: `git-tutorial`.
- (optional) **Description**: `Git tutorial`.
- **Public**: (leave it as is).
- **Initialize this repository with a README**: (leave it unchecked).
- **Add .gitignore**: None (default).
- **Choose a license**: None (default).

After that, please click on the green "Create repository" button.

Congratulations, you have created your first GitHub repository!
The repository is empty, so we need to add a file to it.


## Add a file to the repository
To add a file to the repository, please click on the "uploading an existing file" link.
In the newly opened page, please drag and drop a text file to the drag and drop area.
You can create the file on your computer using any available text editor.
The file can contain any text you want, but usually the programmers like to put "Hello, World!", so let's follow the tradition.
The filename does not matter.

Let's not modify any other fields and click the green "Commit changes" button.
Congratulations, you have added a file to the repository!
